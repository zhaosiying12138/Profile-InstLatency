## Synthetic Reference Metadata

Synthetic values are reference-only and are not used as LLVM-facing claims.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `timing_model` | `config/rvv_timing_model.yaml` |
| `pipe` | `pipe0` |
| `latency_cycles` | `7` |
| `release_cycles` | `1` |
| `measured_delta_cycles` | `15` |

## Marker Deltas

| From | To | Corrected delta cycles |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `start` | `end` | 15 |

## LLVM-Facing Claims

LLVM-facing timing fields are claimable only through raw marker-delta inference across the relevant template family. Synthetic metadata is reference-only.
